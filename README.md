# Blockchain and IOT towards traceability and transparency in supply-chains
> Final year college project

In the current working scenario, manufacturers producing perishable products like medicines face huge losses due to non-adherence to standards along the supply-chain. Irrespective of whose fault it is the cost has to be beared by the producer. We intend to use blockchain to continuously monitor status and bring trust into the supply-chain. Each transaction and hand-over is implemented via smart contracts.
